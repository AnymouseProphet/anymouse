anymouse LaTeX 
==============

This is a LaTeX package that sets the fonts and some other macros used by the
Anymouse Prophet in his political ramblings.

Install the files within `texmf-tree` into your TEXMF-LOCAL directory using the
same structure and then run the `texhash` command so that your LaTeX system
knows about them.

This package is still in development.


`anymouse.sty`
--------------

This is the primary style file in this package. It is dual-licensed LPPL and
MIT.

`ampmisc.sty`
-------------

A complimentary file to `anymouse.sty` that defines macros commonly used by the
Anymouse Prophet in his writings.
