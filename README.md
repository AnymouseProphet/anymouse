anymouse LaTeX 
==============

This is a LaTeX package that sets the fonts and some other macros used by the
Anymouse Prophet in his political ramblings.

Dual-License LPPL and MIT. Whichever floats your boat.

Install the files within `texmf-tree` into your TEXMF-LOCAL directory using the
same structure and then run the `texhash` command so that your LaTeX system
knows about them.

This package is still in development.
